# Build pipelines for hydrologic simulation and forecasting tools

## Overview

This repository contains material to streamline the build, testing and possible deployment of hydrologic simulation and forecasting tools.

These tools have been re-used in projects undertaken for DWL.


As of 2022-03 this contains two pipelines: 

* The default one is preliminary, building a docker image for simulation and forecasting with SWIFT2 via a Jupyter front end
* Under /packages is a pipeline building debian packages of SWIFT2
